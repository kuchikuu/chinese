Explanation: <br>
The goal is to make easily readable "database". <br>
Using a DSV parser (Dash Separated Values <- Yeah!) you can easily parse the list and use it as you wish because it follows this scheme: <br>
SIMPLIFIED - TRADITIONAL - PINYIN - MEANING <br> <br>
I've been thinking whether or not write pinyin as "xin1 wen2" but I have decided not to. <br>
I've also decided to include traditional characters simply because I want to avoid having issues like "OMG Why don't you include traitional chinese, simplified is not a true chinese it's communist WHY WHY OMG <strong>WHY??</strong>" <br>
